# OpenCompany

## Mission

Building the execution layer for AI-driven companies.

## Vision

Every company runs on AI agents that actually understand their context — their goals, their processes, their way of working — and can execute on their behalf.

## Values

1. **Ship fast** - Speed over perfection. Get it out, learn, iterate. A shipped feature beats a planned one.
2. **Human-centered AI** - AI should amplify humans, not replace them. Keep people in the loop where it matters.
3. **Simplicity** - Keep it minimal. Avoid over-engineering. The best code is code you don't have to write.
4. **Flexible + Open** - Build in public, stay adaptable. Open source by default.

## About

OpenCompany is the execution layer for AI-driven companies. We give AI agents persistent context about your organization — your knowledge, strategy, and processes live in a git repo that agents can read, understand, and act on.

No more repeating yourself. No more AI that forgets everything. Just agents that know your company and get things done.
